This directory contains the source code for the web user interface of "From First Principles." This UI is responsible for presenting the website's content to users in a clear, accessible, and engaging manner. The project has been refactored to use **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing a modern, performant, and maintainable foundation.

**[Loïc Muhirwa](https://github.com/justmeloic/)** initiated this project, and we enthusiastically welcome contributions from the community.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The Web UI is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated websites, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. This provides a significant improvement over the original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation, offering better performance, SEO, and developer experience.

## Directory Structure <a name="directory-structure"></a>

The directory is structured following standard Next.js conventions:

```
.
├── components.json
├── next-env.d.ts
├── next.config.mjs
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── public
├── src
│   ├── app
│   ├── components
│   ├── hooks
│   ├── lib
│   ├── providers
│   ├── styles
│   └── types
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

- **`public/`**: This directory mirrors the role of the old `assets` folder. It holds static files like images and fonts that will be served directly.
- **`src/app/`**: This is the core of the Next.js application using the App Router. It contains your pages, layouts, and API routes. The structure within `src/app` will likely reflect the old `pages` and `content` directories, but organized according to Next.js routing conventions.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI components built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **`src/hooks/`**: Holds custom React hooks for reusable logic.
- **`src/lib`**: Contains utility and helper functions.
- **`src/styles/`**: Contains global styles and potentially a setup for Tailwind CSS.
- **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript.
- **`components.json`**: Configuration file for components.

## Development <a name="development"></a>

### Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>

- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Node and NPM/Yarn**: Used to manage and install dependencies.

### Local Development <a name="local-development"></a>

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The development server includes hot-reloading, so changes you make to your code will be reflected in the browser automatically.

### Building <a name="building"></a>

To build the production-ready version of the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This command creates an optimized build of your application in the `.next` directory. Next.js will automatically perform static optimization where possible.

For a fully static export (similar to the original static site):
You would likely use the `next export` command if you've structured your application to be fully statically generatable. However, with Next.js 13+ App router you have to configure output in the `next.config.mjs` file by setting `output: 'export'`.

```bash
npm run export
```

or

```bash
yarn export
```
